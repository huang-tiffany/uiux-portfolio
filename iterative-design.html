            <p>
              Our design team had the privilege of working with Zest, a
              corporate gifting startup, to develop a user flow for a new bulk
              shipping feature, which would allow customers to ship multiple
              orders to a single address (as opposed to shipping to multiple
              addresses).

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              To begin, each team member brainstormed two end-to-end flows for
              possible implementations of a bulk shipping process. Although some
              elements remained consistent in the high-level information
              hierarchy, others — like the visual display of the various
              shipping options — varied from sketch to sketch.
              <br /><br />
              While brainstorming, a few questions arose.
            </p>
            <div class="three-up">
              <div>
                01 <strong>Per-Recipient UI</strong> <br />Since users who ship
                to one address are likely bulk ordering (e.g. for 100+ people)
                and likely won’t want to personalize gifts, are per-recipient UI
                elements necessary?
              </div>
              <div>
                02 <strong>Enabling Bulk Shipping</strong> <br />How should we
                enable bulk shipping? Ideas included drop-down menus, a simple
                checkbox, and a third box in the delivery method section.
              </div>
              <div>
                03 <strong>Shopping Carts</strong> <br />Is a shopping cart
                necessary? How will it interact with the rest of the user flow?
              </div>
            </div>
            <img src="public/zest sketches.png" alt="Brainstorming sketches" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="page-section">
          <div class="subheader">03 <strong>Lofi Wireframes</strong></div>
          <div class="content">
            <div>
              After sketching, we proceeded to make lofi wireframes to narrow
              down our designs before sharing with the client, paying special
              attention to new additions along with the elimination of unrelated
              UI elements.
            </div>
            <div class="three-up">
              <div>
                01 <strong>Delivery Methods</strong> <br />Placing the delivery
                method under the “ship to recipients’ addresses” option as a
                dropdown and third option groups the two shipping options while
                keeping the third virtual gift option separate.
              </div>
              <div>
                02 <strong>Sticky Order Summary</strong> <br />Adding a sticky
                order summary with more specific language clearly communicates
                the total prices after shipping and reduces back-and-forth
                between checkout and order pages.
              </div>
              <div>
                03 <strong>Individual Addresses</strong> <br />
                Removing addresses from the recipients list allows for a more
                streamlined workflow and eliminates an unnecessary step for bulk
                shipping.

            04 <strong>Peer and Advisor Critique</strong>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              We then participated in a critique with around 20 other students
              in our studio to get unbiased feedback (since none were familiar
              with Zest prior) and also met with our advisor, Vanessa Cho, for a
              midpoint check-in.
              <br /><br />
              From the critique, we learned that we should analyze competitors
              and include sketches to show our entire design process. On the
              design side, some specific feedback we received included making
              the delivery method boxes more uniform and making it easier to
              switch between pages of the gift options.
            </p>

              alt="Detail view of the order details lofi screen"
            />
            <p>
              While speaking with Vanessa, she called attention to our copy
              (specifically the phrase “ship all to one address”) and suggested
              examining the language used by Zest’s competitors, in addition to
              minimizing extra clicks in the user flow.

          <div class="subheader">05 <strong>R1 Client Feedback</strong></div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              After implementing this feedback, we recorded a Loom to present
              our first draft to our client, Christine Pun, Founding Designer at
              Zest. Most of her questions pertained to alternative ways of
              displaying information, such as why we broke our shipping methods
              into two instead of three. We realized that we chose this
              primarily for aesthetic reasons and ultimately reverted to
              employing one box per shipping method since it clarified the
              differences between the various options better.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Because there were no major design changes to the wireframe, we
              proceeded to make the high-fidelity prototype, as Zest requested a
              mobile prototype to see what the order summary would look like on
              a smaller screen.
              <br /><br />
              We integrated our minor design changes, including changes in copy
              and distinct delivery options, directly in our high-fidelity
              prototype.

            <p>
              Using Zest’s existing branding based on their hifi Figma screens,
              we used Milk Bar as the in-situ brand as the foundation for our
              style guide, noting that Zest tends to use their clients’ colors
              for greater personalization and brand identification.
            </p>
            <img src="public/zest style guide.png" alt="Style guide" />
            <p>
              With a sans serif typeface without styling like Centra2 for
              readability, we kept the text size consistent across mobile and
              desktop to allow for easier implementation of our design on
              multiple devices. Adding to the original style guide, we included
              a few more icons, created an option to remove cart items on hover,
              and added a custom calendar when selecting a delivery date.
            </p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Finally, we presented our hi-fi prototype to Christine and Jeremy,
              a co-founder of Zest. Along with discussing possible A/B tests in
              the future to ground the order summary design and having the
              option to change the number of recipients in the order summary, we
              also talked through the order of the page sections and how that
              can affect the user flow.
            </p>

            </video>
            <p>
              After our meeting, we took their advice into account and added an
              input field to the order summary, since allowing users to edit the
              number of recipients as they order made more sense for the entire
              flow. However, we also set the default number of recipients to 1
              so that the original totals would be easier to understand at first
              glance. This would also update as users change the number of
              recipients in the “Recipients” page section during the main page
              flow to stay consistent with the general flow.

            <p>
              Working with a team in a UI/UX setting was surprisingly smooth,
              likely due to the fact that all of the team members had a
              background in design. Being able to receive feedback from a real
              client was also an informative process, which allowed us to
              contextualize our own design process in a real working
              environment.
