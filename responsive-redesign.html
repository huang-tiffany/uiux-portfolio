            <p>
              Although TP TEA, my favorite boba store back at home, already has
              a branded interface, I wanted to bring a more technical and
              user-driven focus to a website that currently seems to be more
              storytelling and aesthetic-driven.

            02 <strong>Identifying Usability Problems</strong>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              While analyzing the website, I categorized its usability issues
              into three categories: efficiency, learnability, and memorability.
            </p>
            <div class="three-up">
              <div>
                01 <strong>Efficiency</strong> <br />Interactive elements like
                the navigation bar only appear once the user starts scrolling,
                which costs extra time and can confuse users due to its
                unconventional lack of appearance.
              </div>
              <div>
                02 <strong>Learnability</strong> <br />Some elements, despite
                being on the English version of the site, are still written in
                Chinese; outside of the inconsistent language, animations on the
                homepage also load in at different rates, which can lead to a
                less smooth user experience.
              </div>
              <div>
                03 <strong>Memorability</strong> <br />The lengthy summaries of
                each section on the homepage become redundant with the other
                pages on the site, which can slow users down when trying to
                revisit a specific area of the site.
              </div>
            </div>
            <img
              src="public/image2.png"
              alt="WebAIM screenshot of TP TEA site"
            />
            <p>
              Using WebAIM WAVE, software that detects various accessibility
              issues for the web, I also discovered other errors, including
              missing alternative text for images, empty links, and broken ARIA
              references, in addition to other alerts.
            </p>

          <div class="subheader">03 <strong>Sketches</strong></div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              For my sketches, I focused on both the structure of the page and
              on working through sections where I felt visual hierarchy was a
              bit more disorganized.
            </p>
            <img src="public/ideation.jpg" alt="Ideation sketches" />
            <p>
              The final sketch combined a few elements from the initial
              sketches, with a simplified page structure and modular components.
              Although it stayed pretty loyal to the original site, it also
              reorganized the information in a way that was more consistent and
              readable.

          <div class="subheader">04 <strong>Lofi Wireframes</strong></div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Taking these into Figma, I drew up some wireframes to resolve some
              of the accessibility issues from before.
              <br /><br />
              Some of the improvements made to the page included a fixed
              navigation bar for easy access to information, combining related
              page sections to condense the page, placing buttons in consistent
              and identifiable locations, adding a site directory footer that
              groups a link index with TP TEA's social icons, and eliminating
              pop-ups. On smaller screen sizes, horizontal scrolling is also
              introduced to save vertical space.

              Even though I have had a decent amount of frontend and UI/UX
              experience, I still felt like I was able to learn some more CSS
              techniques that I hadn't known before, and seeing this website
              through a more accessibility-focused lens rather than one that was
              more graphic design-focused was also interesting as well.
