            <p>
              Though review and travel sites have existed for years, current
              databases house disparate sources of information in widely varying
              interfaces that make information gathering difficult. As such, I
              sought to design a single source of New York museum travel
              information, starting with its most famous destinations.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Before designing, I analyzed Spotify, Pinterest, and Amazon as
              examples of different kinds of aggregators to determine the most
              important features to implement. Although the three sites had a
              lot of features in common, their designs differed slightly within
              how they balanced master lists and user-created lists.

                01 <strong>Spotify</strong> <br />Despite lacking a “master
                list” for all saved songs, Spotify’s extensive filtering and
                organization, combined with its simplification of actions into
                streamlined icons, declutters the interface to highlight main
                actions for users to take.
              </div>
              <div>
                02 <strong>Pinterest</strong> <br />Pinterest had more of a
                simplified layout, eliminating filters while using a tree layout
                and one-click saves to layer secondary actions under the most
                pertinent ones.
              </div>
              <div>
                03 <strong>Amazon</strong> <br />Combining qualitative customer
                ratings with to quantitative metrics, along with the
                straightforward grouping and layout, makes Amazon’s design more
                robust while allowing users to do more without compromising
                visual clarity.

            <p>
              Although having a master list, one-click save, and view specs
              weren’t universal across the aggregators, they still seemed to be
              beneficial for the user experience, which is why I decided to
              implement these three functions as part of my website.

              <br /><br />

              Starting with lofi mockups, I sketched various screens for how the
              user journey might look as users navigate through the site.
              Considering the interfacing of different menus, I also played
              around with page layout and how it might be affected by the
              opening and closing of different compartments on the page.
            </p>

            <p>
              After some revision, I took the lofi mockups into a higher
              fidelity, adding color and font to determine the visual style of
              the pages. The designs changed throughout the development process
              as I discovered holes in my user flow and changed the designs to
              match potential user actions, but the core of the visual identity
              and experience stayed relatively consistent.

              The final interface details various museums in New York for
              visiting or learning about art history. The two buttons in the top
              left corner allow for viewing two different aggregators, one for a
              master list (favorites), and another for a more specific list
              (save for later).

              Within these lists, users have the ability to switch between grid
              and list views of the data. The three menus employ similar design
              principles so they can be grouped visually and experienced
              similarly in terms of the visual language, actions, and motion
              implemented.

              Within each card displayed on the page, users can view information
              and visit links to the museum sites upon hovering, as well as add
              and remove cards from both lists. A filter menu, opened via the
              icon in the bottom left, allows for users to simultaneously sort
              by museum ticket price and filter based on area and genre. The
              number of results, like the number of favorited or saved items, is
              displayed in the filter menu for consistency and to show when
              there may be no results returned. All of the menus have the
              ability to clear filters or aggregated items.

              Overall, even though it was a difficult process to navigate
              through the different hooks while keeping track of all the moving
              parts of my application, I thought it was an informative way of
              translating market research into stronger products. Additionally,
              finding the most visually appealing way of displaying data while
              creating a fluid and satisfying experience is an ongoing
              challenge, but it was a fulfilling way to learn how translating
              designs into code could be applied to real-life projects.
